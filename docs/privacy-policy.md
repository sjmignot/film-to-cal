## Who is requesting data?

Access to your calender is requested by Sceance, a fully open source application made by Samuel Mignot.

## What Type of Data is Collected?

**No User Data is collected**. Sceance needs event write access to your calendar to automatically add movie showings that you have approved
in the course of the application flow. Sceance will only add movie events that you have explicitly approved and does not read your
calendar or otherwise use or modify your data.

## Why and How Data is Collected?

Write access is requested so that sceance can write selected movie showtimes directly to your calendar: this is the only time that
sceance interfaces with your Google Calendar account.
